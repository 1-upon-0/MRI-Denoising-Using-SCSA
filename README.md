# MRI-Denoising-Using-SCSA
I worked on the Semi Classical Signal Analysis in the summers of 2019 at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).  My main aim was to improve the exisiting algorithms in the field for MRI denoising. 

# Running the code
•Download the zip file. <br>
•Open the main function file. <br>
•Import the .mat MRI files containing the image with either 1, 5, or 7% noise in them. <br>
•Choose the SCSA paramters- h, gm as well as the Ns and Np parameters. <br>
•Run the code and obtain the denoised images.
